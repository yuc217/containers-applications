the http://localhost:3000/statistics now shows {"added_todos":3}
only counts when new request are added, not counting the ones already there

works the same by running:
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

start the app:
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 MONGO_URL=mongodb://the_username:the_password@localhost:3456/the_database npm run dev
